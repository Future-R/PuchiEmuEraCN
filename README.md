==== PuchiEmuEra Anchor =============================================================

This project is an extension of PCDRP's PuchiEmuEra executable, which in itself
is a modification of the EmuEra project (https://osdn.net/projects/emuera),
version 1821.

The anchor was created to facilitate easier translation of Era games using clipboard
readers such as Translation Aggregator.


The project is written in C# using .NET 2.0 and is best worked on with Visual
Studio or JetBrains Rider. Beyond the .NET framework it requires no extra
libraries or frameworks.
